          on Climate Change and Public Health, scheduled for July 21-22, 2025,

          experts, researchers, and policymakers to examine the critical effects
          of climate change on public health and to discuss effective strategies
          for response and adaptation. Conference Theme: “Navigating the
          Intersection: Climate Change, Public Health, and Resilience” Under the
          theme “Navigating the Intersection: Climate Change, Public Health, and
          Resilience,” this conference aims to delve into the intricate
          connections between climate change and health outcomes. Our goal is to
          investigate innovative solutions, research insights, and policies that
